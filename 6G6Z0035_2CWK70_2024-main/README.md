# 6G6Z0035: Software Testing & Quality Assurance

This repository contains the code for a Worker Service Prototype being developed as a part of the Landfill Labs project. This is your System Under Test (SUT).

## Understanding this repository

To understand the contents of this repository, you should do the following (if you haven't already):

1. Review the supplementary materials from 1CWK30. The *Spec* and *Memorandum of Understanding* documents in particular.
2. Review the [technical memo](./TechMemo.md) included in this repository. This describes the Command Line Interface through which the Worker Service Prototype is exposed.
3. Familiarise yourself with the code itself; Use your understanding of the code to enhance your Test Case Design Specification.

## Getting started

At some point after you've familiarised yourself with the code and made a decent start on your Test Case Design Specification, you'll probably want to implement some automated tests to include with your submission. To do this, you should first clone the repository:

1. Create a folder in the format: `Sam_Attwood_12345678` (but using your name and student number).
2. Navigate inside this folder using your preferred terminal and run: `git clone https://github.com/samattwood9/6G6Z0035_2CWK70_2024.git` (if you have a GitHub account you may wish to create your own remote and clone that instead, you can click the "use this template" button to do this).
3. At this point, you should be able to open up the repository using IntelliJ and write automated tests just like we've been doing in the labs (consult the relevant lab worksheets if you're not sure). It's over to you... Good luck!

## Submitting your submission

Your submission should be submitted to Moodle before the deadline as detailed fully in the Assessment Brief. Remember, your submission should include: (1) A Test Case Design Specification (in MS Word/Excel format); (2) A SUT repository (an updated version of this repository); (3) A defect report (in MS Word format).
